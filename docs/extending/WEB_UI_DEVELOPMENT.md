# Web UI Development [PLANNED]

A first-party web UI is not part of the current codebase. Downstream projects can still build dashboards by reading `~/.multiclaude/state.json` and (optionally) calling the socket API documented in `SOCKET_API.md`.

If a web UI is added upstream, document the real API surface here and keep examples aligned with the implemented handlers.
